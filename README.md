# GitFinder
This uses the Git users api to fetch them and show the repos. 


This is a simple Projct using plain and pure javascript with no other js libraries. 
uses fetch API to fetch and show the git user upon search.

Main focus was to practice more on UI part .
pS : Its a starter therefore, the UI might be bit buggy. Will be improving this further.
